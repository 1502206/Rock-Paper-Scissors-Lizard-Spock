Development Test

Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock 

Program has been completed to meet the following manditory cryteria:

- A .NET Core/C# Console application
- To interact with another human or the application
- Display game winner
- Number of turns taken
- Most used move during a game

Program also meets one of the streach goals as listed below:

- Extend the move list to include Lizard & Spock

Notes:

Moves list was extended however complete entry of the word "Spock" will unfortunitly trigger the output of "Scissors".
This error is due to the program serching for the first letter and/or the whole word beginning with said letter. 
This was discovered at the end of development, modification would have required ground up rebuild.
